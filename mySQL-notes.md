**Notes on installing mySQL**

# Importance of Password

PW Hints
- Not bojangles
- Not 1024

**Remember when entering password, there is no output. DO NOT FREAK OUT WHEN NOTHING SHOWS UP.**

# Importance of Semicolon

Nothing will End until ";" is used
- I forgot to use the ";" when creating a database
- I used the \c command to get back to the root mysql user
- I was worried this could be an issue later, but Dr. Burns noted later that nothing will end without the semicolon
	- I then realized this was my original issue and knew it would not be a problem later on

# Things to remember

CLEAR will not clear the screen under mysql, use:
```
ctrl + l
```
