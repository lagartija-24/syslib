Notes for installing the Apache Web Server

#Differences in video vs script

After installing apache2
- script does not show changing directories
- video shows the following before installing w3m

```
cd /var/log
```
```
ls
```
```
cd apache2
```

Dr. Burns begins this with an off script comment so I get a little confused
when the script and video don't match up.
I go ahead and change directories as shown in the video and it seems to work fine.

#w3m observations

My subnet or private IP address under option 2
- 10.128.0.2
This is unique to me, as opposed to the loop back address
- 127.0.0.1
- localhost

**Both work.**
